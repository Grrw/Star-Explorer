# Star (Wars) Explorer
I am finished working on this for now. It's fairly simple to use, but inconvenient to navigate.

## To-Do:
- [X] Create Character Viewer
- [X] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add the ability to jump to character
- [ ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add jump to character based on name (?)
- [X] Create Planet Viewer
- [ ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add the ability to jump to planet 
- [ ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add jump to planet based on name (?)
- [X] Create Film Viewer
- [ ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add the ability to view planets in the films (?)
- [ ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add the ability to view characters in the films (?)
- [X] Create Vehicle Viewer
- [X] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add the ability to jump to vehicle
- [X] Create Starship Viewer
- [X] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > Add the ability to jump to ship
